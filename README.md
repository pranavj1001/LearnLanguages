# LearnLanguages
Learn new and different languages, frameworks and libraries.

<br>

Hey there, 

This repo contains the code for learning many languages. I'll be adding more languages.

**Update** - Initially I had plans to add learning code for languages only but now I'll be adding info about frameworks and libraries also.

### Target Audience

1. People who want to learn languages in a short period of time.
2. People who want the sample code for remembering the syntax of the languages.
3. People who just want to brush up or update their knowledge of a particular language.
4. People who want to just clear the basics of a language before an interview.

### Added Languages

1. ES6 (EcmaScript 2015)
2. PHP

### Added Frameworks

1. Django - Source: [Django Girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/) The tutorial provided here contains all the information that you need to get started with django. I learnt the basics from here. In this repo, I've just posted the complete project that you can build by following the tutorial. You can follow the code given here incase you're having some problems in your code.

### Added Data Structures

1. Linked Lists
2. Stacks
3. Queues
4. Binary Search Trees

**Note:** Currently I've added data structures in python only.

### Upcoming Languages

1. C
2. Python
3. C#

### Upcoming Frameworks

1. Angular 4

### Upcoming Data Structures

1. AVL Trees

### Learning/Reading Strategy

Just go through the code file from the starting. The file is prepared in a such that it starts from basics first and then covers the advanced topics.
Uncomment the 'console.log' lines to read the message as you go through the code. Finally, play around the code and get your hands dirty.

### Want to contribute?

Sure, you can add files for new languages or can update the existing files. Just send me a pull request.
